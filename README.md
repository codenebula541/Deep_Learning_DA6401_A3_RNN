## 🔤 Hindi Transliteration using RNNs with Attention

This project implements a neural transliteration system that converts Hindi words written in Latin script into the Devanagari script using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). It explores the strengths and limitations of vanilla Seq2Seq models and how attention mechanisms improve performance on complex sequences.

## 📈 Results

| Model              | Test Accuracy |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Vanilla Seq2Seq   | 39.30%        |
| Attention-based   | **40.50%**    |

📌 **Insight:** Attention model improved accuracy by learning to focus on relevant input characters, especially for longer or ambiguous words.
